## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
print("2")
```

This is very useful to both run code and take notes. We will use this document to run some more complex examples so you do not have to write everything. 

R Markdown documents have several options but we will not focus on them today.

## Objects in R

Now we will create different objects in R and see how to differentiate them.

**Exercise 1: create a list named "l" of numbers from 1 to 5**

```{r}
l <- list(1,2,3,4,5)
```

**Exercise 2: create a vector named "v" of numbers from 1 to 5**

```{r}
v <- 1:5
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
v <- c(1:5)
```

**Exercise 3: create a dataframe named "d" consisting of 3 columns: the first one will be the species name, the two other ones will be two traits of your choice**

```{r}
d <- data.frame(species_name = c("Lupus_lupus", "Canis_lupus", "Tetrao_urogalus"), body_mass_kg = c(30,15,10), type = c("mammal", "mammal","bird"))
```


**Exercise 4: Create a matrix "m" of dimension 3 by 2**

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
```

**Exercise 5: create a factor list "f" with the elements high, medium and low in the right order**

```{r}
f <- factor(c("high", "low", "low", "medium", "medium", "high", "medium"), levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
```

## Exploring your data

For this part we will use a dataframe that we will create now. In this dataframe we will have 20 species named after letters. These species will have a body mass that will be randomly attributed using the _rnorm()_ function, we will see what it does during the data exploration. These species will also have or not the ability to fly.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(Species = letters[1:20], body_mass = rnorm(20, 25,2), fly = sample(c(rep("fly",20),rep("no_fly",20)), 20))
```

```{r}
summary(data)
```

```{r}
head(data)
```

```{r}
tail(data)
```

**Exercise 6: Study the different properties of the object l2. What kind of object is it? What is/are the data type.s of this object? What is the dimension of the object?** 

```{r}

```



## How to do several time the same task : FOR and WHILE loops

You can use FOR loops when you want to repeat several time the same task. It can be iterative or not.

**Exercise 7: Create a loop that will calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10. it will do (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)=55**

**Exercise 8: Create a loop that will calculate the sum of all numbers until the sum reach or decrease 100**

### Recursive naming within a loop

Here is an example of how to create and assign variable names recursively within a loop. For instance if you want to create several variable names to store the results of your operation

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){ #here I setup my for loop
  
  variable_name <- paste("my_variable_name", i, sep="_") #here I create my variable name using the paste function that will create a string that concatenates the different elements I put within brackets. Here it will be "my_variable_name" and the number corresponding to my loop iteration "i". The option sep= is used to assign what will link the different parts of my final string. In that case I used the underscore "_"
  
  assign(x = variable_name, value = i) #Here I assign the value i to my new variable. This is a very simple example, but you can actually assigne more complicated results or objects.
  
}


```
